            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Those Earls after they received their government in each County, divided them into Centurians or hundreds; and in every hundred was appointed a Centurian or Constable, who had his portion and limits assigned him to keepe and defend with the power of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and were to be ready upon all alarums with their Armes against the common enemy. These in some places are called <hi>Wapentakes,</hi> which in French doth signifie taking of Armen. <hi>Myrror</hi> p. 10. 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>fol.</hi> 16, 17.</p>

               <p>And Justices of peace being Judges of Record were first ordained by stat. as appeareth by 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. with such other addition of power as later statutes have given unto them.</p>
               <p>Justices of peace then having their being by vertue of the statute-Law, they are to be ordained in the same manner as the statutes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and not otherwise.</p>
               <p n="1">1. After their first institution the statutes did leave the choise of them indefinitly in the Crown (as I conceive) untill the statute of 12 <hi>R.</hi> 2.27. Which statute doth intrust the Chancellor, Treasurer, Keeper of the privy seale, Steward and Chamberlaine of the Kings House, the Clarke of the Rolles, the Justices of both Benches, Barrons of the Exchequer and others, to name and make them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Other statutes doe appoint what persons shall be chosen to be Justices of the peace; Namely, such as reside in the same County where they are Justices of peace, as stat. 12 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. And they must be of the most sufficient Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen of the same County. <hi>Stat.</hi> 17. <hi>Richard</hi> 2.10. and dwelling in the same County, 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. (Except Lords and Justices of Assizes) upon this last Statute it may be doubted if choyce may be made of any Lords, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Assizes which have no residence or estate in the County where they are so made Justices of the peace: which if it doth, it doth repeale all former statutes which confines them to such persons as are of the
<pb facs="tcp:197497:4"/>same County, which I conceave is against their meaning, for that statute doth onely dispence with the residence of Lords and Justices of Assize, because men of the same County, inhabiting in the County where they are Justices of peace, in regard of their other imployments in the Common-wealth, which necessarily requireth their absence, and so it amounteth onely to a dispensation for their residency.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> True! such is the practice, but the doubt is how warantable his Act is, for the statute of 18. <hi>H.</hi> 6. doth give the Lord Chauncellor (alone by himselfe) no other power but in Case there be no men of sufficiency in the County, and where none of 20.l. <hi>per annum</hi> are to be found. For in such Case hee hath power to appoint such as hee conceives are men most fit. But in case there are men of sufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in the County to be found, he must joyne with the others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the statute, <hi>viz.</hi> the Treasurer, privy Seale, &amp;c. who have a joynt and undivided power with him.

               <p>The choise of these as was formerly mentioned was by the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in the County Court: But of later times they have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same power, being appointed by the King, under the shadow of his prerogative.</p>

No more then where the statute giving power unto Justices of peace to enquire of a riot, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the power of the Kings Bench, which no man will affirme.
